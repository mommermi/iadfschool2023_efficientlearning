# GRSS IADF School 2023: Label-Efficient Deep Learning in Remote Sensing

Michael Mommert, University of St. Gallen, 2023

This respository contains the resources for the course "Label-efficient Deep Learning in Remote Sensing" of the [IADF School 2023](https://iadf-school.org/). 

**Presentation slides** are available [here](https://github.com/mommermi/iadfschool2023_efficientlearning/blob/main/efficient_learning_mommert.pdf?raw=1) and a compressed slide deck is available [here](https://github.com/mommermi/iadfschool2023_efficientlearning/blob/main/efficient_learning_mommert_compressed.pdf?raw=1).

**Code** discussed in this course is available in the form of a Jupyter Notebook in this repository. We will use this Notebook in the cloud during the course. If you have a Google account, we recommend that you launch the Notebook with Colab, if not, feel free to use the Binder launcher below:
